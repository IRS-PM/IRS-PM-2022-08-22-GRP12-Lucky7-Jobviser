JOBVISER｜An Intelligent Employment Analysis And Guidance System 


## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Work is a major factor affecting people's happiness index. In the World Happiness Report 2017, the United Nations specifically observes the influence of occupational status on happiness from the work dimension in Chapter 6. According to the data of Gallup World Poll 2014-2016, countries and regions with higher unemployment rate have lower public happiness index. Today's job seekers face two common dilemmas. Firstly, under the influence of the COVID-19, the great depression and the high unemployment rate, enterprises have greatly reduced the number of recruitment and raised recruiting standards. For job seekers, the sharp deterioration of the external employment environment has caused job seekers great pressure. The second problem is the self-perception of job seekers. There are quite a lot of job seekers who have biases in their self-awareness. For young graduates, they do not know what type of work their current personal abilities can match, and what type of work their personal characteristics are suitable for, so they are often confused about future career planning; For example, they are often troubled by the problem that the work they are engaged in is not suitable for their personality, so they are often deeply troubled by work anxiety, but they do not know how to break the current deadlock.


In order to solve the above problems, we have designed a career guidance and analysis system. The system realizes the evaluation of job seekers' personal hard strength and personality characteristics. Therefore, our system can not only provide job seekers with suitable job types according to their own abilities, but also according to users' personal wishes and needs, choose their ideal career type for users and recommend them to users. What's more, the system will analyze the differences between the occupation matching the user's ability and the ideal occupation of the user, and provide the user with corresponding employment guidance suggestions. One of the features of our system is the introduction of a personality test section, which can better mine the user's own characteristics, help users match more suitable jobs, and make more targeted and personalized career recommendations for users. This function of the system will help job seekers to deepen their understanding of themselves, so as to have a more adequate plan for their career and improve their success rate in finding a job. The new employment ideas provided by the system provide users with a variety of employment options, and they no longer need to be bound by the past  single experience and narrow cognition.
